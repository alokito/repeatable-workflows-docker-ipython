# I'm this guy...

* Founder of [Atlas](https://atlas.oreilly.com), O'Reilly Media's next generation authoring tool
* Currently exploring how to produce "next generation content"
* I'm really excited about [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) and the workflows needed to produce them

# Agenda

## Quick introduction to [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## O'Reilly experiments with IPython Notebooks

## Docker as a critical tool for shareable, repeatable environments

---


# IPython Notebooks

### "an open-source, interactive computing environment that lets you combine live code, narrative text, mathematics, plots and rich media in one document."

* 500K â€“ 1.5M users
* Used in scientific community to "narrate computation"
* Applications as varied as
  * Data visualization and plotting
  * Earth Science and Geo-Spatial data
  * Economics
  * Machine Learning
  * Physics, Chemistry, Biology
  * Psychology and Neuroscience
  * Social sciences
  * Statistics, Machine Learning and Data Science

# O'Reilly and IPython Notebooks

* Powerful tool for creating learning experiences
* Looking to offer Notebook-based learning content (online and in person) 
* [Just Enough Math](https://github.com/odewahn/jem-docker) by [Paco Nathan](http://liber118.com/pxn/) at Strata (~200 attendees)

# Content originated in [Atlas](https://atlas.oreilly.com)

# JSON data format

* Atlas source was [HTML5](https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook)
* Converting to Notebook format (`ipynb`) was straightforward
* Internally, Notebooks uses a JSON format composed of "cells"
  * Heading
  * Markdown
  * Code

```javascript
...
{
 "cell_type": "markdown",
 "metadata": {},
 "source": [
  "### The Units of Probability Density\n",
  "\n",
  "This is an important thing to remember: the units of a ", 
  "probability density are the inverse of the units of the",
  "quantity in question. Keeping this in mind will help you",
  "recognize all sorts of common mistakes in computations of probability."
 ]
},
...

```

# Collaborative Workflows using git and GitHub

* GitHub provides easy way to share work with colleagues and collaborators, and is the preferred way to share Notebook content
* Notebooks are plain JSON text, so you _can_ collaborate effectively using git / GitHub (more on this later)
* Supports the classic [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model
  * Clone the repository
  * Make a local branch
  * Commit locally
  * Push local commits to a new branch
  * Send a pull request

---

# Sharing Notebook text is easy, but ensuring a common *computing environment* emerged as a key challenge

* We started with [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/)
* This broke down quickly
  * Different versions of Python (2 vs 3)
  * Different package managers (pip, brew, easy_install, etc)
  * Non-Python based packages (i.e., Fortran-based numerical computing libraries)
  * Missing backing services (databases, redis, etc)

---

# Docker to the rescue

.center[<img src="images/docker-logo.png" width=90%/>]

* Easy way to reuse and modify "base" images
* Simple formats (Dockerfile and Fig files) for specifying project-specific dependencies
* Ability to package everything (code, server, and dependencies) into a shareable image
* Easy to take snapshots and audit across time

---

# Pre-built base images

* Many project, IPython Notebooks included, offer pre-built images with many of the dependencies already installed (and maintained!)
* I started with [ipython/scipystack](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ipython/scipystack/)
  * cython, h5py, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, patsy, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn, sympy, yt

# Dockerfile

The Dockerfile allows you to specify a base image, add your dependencies and code, setup the environment, and other "traditional" sysadmin-style tasks.  

Here's an example.  The highlighted lines select the base image:

```bash
*FROM ipython/scipystack
MAINTAINER Andrew Odewahn "http://odewahn.com"

RUN apt-get update
RUN pip install Flask

WORKDIR /usr/src

CMD ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser

```

---

# Dockerfile -- Adding Dependencies

The Dockerfile allows you to specify a base image, add your dependencies and code, setup the environment, and other "traditional" sysadmin-style tasks.  

Here's an example.  The highlighted lines select add some dependencies:

```bash
FROM ipython/scipystack
MAINTAINER Andrew Odewahn "http://odewahn.com"

*RUN apt-get update
*RUN pip install Flask

WORKDIR /usr/src

CMD ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser

```

---

# fig.yml

[Fig](http://www.fig.sh/) provides a simple way to build and start Docker containers should start.

The highlighted lines map the current directory on the host to `/usr/src` in the container:

```yml
web:
  build: .
*  volumes:
*    - .:/usr/src:rw
  ports:
    - "8888:8888"
```

---

# Simple to package and share

```bash
$ docker build -t odewahn/jem-docker .
$ docker push odewahn/jem-docker
```

$ docker history <container_id>
```
